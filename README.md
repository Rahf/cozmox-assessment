# Hello!

Thanks for giving me the opportunity to interview. I tried my best to complet the assignment to it's fullest in the alloted 24 hour period. I left some `@todo` for myself :)

### Running the App

There are two main folders for front and backends respectively. Also note, I used mySQL as the datastore, and Redis as the message queue, so those will be required and running (see `.env.example` for configuration)

##### Front End

navigate to `cd frontend`
run: `npm install`
run: `npm start` (or `npm run dev` for local testing)

##### Back End

navigate to `cd backend`
run: `npm install`
run: `npm start`

Thanks! For any questions, email me: rahfnoor@gmail.com
